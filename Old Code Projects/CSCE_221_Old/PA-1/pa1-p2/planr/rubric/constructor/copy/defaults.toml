copy constructor â€“ makes a copy of a collection (aka deep copy)

Test case:
* Empty collection is created. 
* N number of Stress_ball() is/are inserted using insert_item().
* Copy constructor is called and checked if the data is getting copied.

If this case does not pass, you can check if:
* Collections have default constructor which accepts capacity as argument.
* Copy constructor, insert_item(), total_items() are defined and working.
* total_items of the object that is copied is same as the original object.
* What happens with memory locations  of objects when a copy constructor is used. Are they same or different?

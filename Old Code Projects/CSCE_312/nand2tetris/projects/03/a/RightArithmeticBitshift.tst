//Important test Cases include:
// load = 0, in = 1, tick, tock, output shift by 1 bit
// load = 1, in = 0, tick, tock, output shift by 1 bit and MSB is replaced with 0
// load = 1, in = 1, tick, tock, output shift by 1 bit and MSB is replaced with 1
// load = 0, in = 0, tick, tock, output shift by 1 bit
// load = 1, in = 1, reset = 1, tick, tock, output becomes 0000

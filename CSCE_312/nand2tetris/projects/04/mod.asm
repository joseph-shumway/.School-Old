//This asm computes the modular of two numbers
//Assuming R0 stores the number a and R1 stores the number n
//so in normal programming language, the goal is to compute RAM[R0]%RAM[R1]
//The result will be put to R2
//Assuming RAM[R1] is positive integer and RAM[R0] is non-negative integer

//See the mod.cmp,mod.tst file to understand the input and output structure

//Put your code here

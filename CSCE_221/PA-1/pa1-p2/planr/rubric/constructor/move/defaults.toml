move constructor â€“ efficiently creates a new collection from an existing one (without copying aka
shallow copy)

Test case:
* Empty collection is created. 
* N number of Stress_ball() is/are inserted using insert_item().
* Move constructor is called and checked if the data is getting moved.

If this case does not pass, you can check if:
* Collections have default constructor which accepts capacity as argument.
* Move constructor, insert_item(), is_empty(), total_items() are defined and working.
* What happens with memory locations when a move constructor is used. Are they same or different?
* Should the object that is passed to the constructor be empty after constructor's operation is completed?
